# reqstress
`reqstress` is a benchmarking&stressing tool that can send raw HTTP requests. It's written in Go and uses 
[fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) library instead of Go's default http library, because of its 
lightning-fast performance.

## Why Do We Need Another Benchmarking Tool?
There are really great benchmarking tools out there such as [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk), 
[bombardier](https://github.com/codesenberg/bombardier), [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey), 
[ab](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/tr/programs/ab.html). Some of them don't support sending custom requests, they 
are only sending a GET request to a given URL. Some of them support custom requests but it's really hard to craft one 
by using command line parameters. I wanted to create a tool that can read a raw HTTP request from a text file and 
replays it. 

So, you can copy your favorite request from Burp Suite, Fiddler etc. and pass it to the `reqstress` directly. It would 
be useful for stressing authenticated endpoints and specific requests that create a huge load.

## reqstress vs. Other Tools
`reqstress` is not the fastest benchmarking tool, but it's not bad either. I tested a couple of popular tools on a $20 
Linode server. Here are the results:

| Tool         | Num. of Sent Requests | Duration |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------- |
| wrk          | ~45000                | 10s      |
| bombardier   | ~41000                | 10s      |
| ab           | ~40000                | 10s      |
| reqstress    | ~39304                | 10s      |
| hey          | ~35127                | 10s      |
| goldeneye.py | ~10913                | 10s      |

# Installation
## From Binary

You can download the pre-built binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/utkusen/reqstress/releases) page and 
run. For example:

```
$ wget https://github.com/utkusen/reqstress/releases/download/v0.1.1/reqstress_0.1.1_Linux_amd64.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf reqstress_0.1.1_Linux_amd64.tar.gz
$ ./reqstress --help
```

## From Source
1. Install Go on your system
2. Run: `go get -u github.com/utkusen/reqstress`

# Usage
`reqstress` requires 3 parameters to run: 

1. `-r` : Path of the request file. For example: `-r request.txt`. Request file should contain a raw HTTP request. For 
example:

```http
POST /wp-login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 1.1.1.1
Content-Length: 107
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://1.1.1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://1.1.1.1/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F1.1.1.1%2Fwp-admin%2F&reauth=1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: tr-TR,tr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7
Cookie: wordpress_test_cookie=WP%20Cookie%20check
Connection: close

log=admin&pwd=asdadsasdads
```

2. `-w` : The number of workers to run. The default value is 500. You can increase or decrease this by testing out the 
capability of your system.
3. `-d` : Duration of the test (in seconds). Default is infinite.
